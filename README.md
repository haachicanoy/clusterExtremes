## Attribution

This project includes code adapted from:

- katerobsau, **clusterExtremes** (GitHub repository)  
  https://github.com/katerobsau/clusterExtremes

We used a fork with **minor modifications** to selected functions to support the analyses in **Global hotspots of co-occurring extreme droughts in agriculture**. These changes are limited to implementation details (e.g., function inputs/outputs and workflow integration) and do not alter the underlying approach of the original code.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.
