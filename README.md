## Attribution

This project includes code adapted from:

- katerobsau, **clusterExtremes** (GitHub repository)  
  https://github.com/katerobsau/clusterExtremes

We used a fork with **minor modifications** to selected functions to support the analyses in **Global hotspots of co-occurring extreme droughts in agriculture**. These changes are limited to implementation details (e.g., function inputs/outputs and workflow integration) and do not alter the underlying approach of the original code.

See `CHANGELOG.md` for details.

In order to align with the rest of the workflow, this forked version of the package must be installed on the machine that executes the scripts from the GitHub repository agroclimExtremes (https://github.com/haachicanoy/agroclimExtremes).
